## ðŸ”¥ PROJECT OVERVIEW

After examining a simple ski game implementation, I've updated our plan for the TDETest shooter. We'll create a fast-paced survival game where players control a blue rectangle, fighting waves of enemies with increasing difficulty. I've incorporated some structural improvements from the ski game's approach.
